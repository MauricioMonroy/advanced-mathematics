# advanced-mathematics
In this project a Java code will be written to calculate different geometric figures for a task of the Mathematics component of the Technology in Analysis and Software Development of SENA. The aim of the project is to develop an algorithm that allows the user to enter the data of different figures, such as the radius of a circle, the base and height of a triangle or the sides of a square, and obtain the area and perimeter of each. It also calculates the volume of regular solids and other figures in three dimensions. The code is based on the use of abstract classes to define the common properties and methods of geometric figures. The program also uses exceptions to control possible user input errors, and displays the results in a console in a clear and orderly manner.
